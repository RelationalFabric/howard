/**
 * Howard: The logical engine for a truly relational world
 *
 * Howard is built on Canon's foundation. Users should import primitive types
 * like Predicate and TypeGuard directly from @relational-fabric/canon.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * import { Predicate, TypeGuard } from '@relational-fabric/canon'
 * import { claims, type Claim } from '@relational-fabric/howard'
 * ```
